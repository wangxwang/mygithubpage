          <div class="col-md-12">
              <p>This was a project to familiarize myself with some of the vast possible applications
              of manipulating shaders in Three.js. There are two meshes in the scene that have custom
              shader attached, the clouds and the background. There are various ways to interact with
              the scene via dat.GUI, keyboard, and mouse interactions, so that the user can also
              experiment with the scene.</p>

              <p>This project also demonstrates the importance of using the depth buffer algorithm and
                employing the painter's algorithm, drawing clouds from furthest to nearest. This personally
                gave me a lot of grief and headaches while writing the scene, so I found it pertinent to include
                a feature that addresses this. You can see the importance by turning on/off the depthTest in the
                GUI while allowing a ball in the scene to fly through the clouds.

              <p>Note: The alpha version was modelled on code modified from
                <a href="http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~fkhor001/ThreeJs/Personal_webpage/" target="_blank">Farzad Khorasani</a>.
              For this iteration, the code from Khorasani was completely scrapped. The current
              iteration is much more a build from the ground up referencing pieces from the
              <a href="http://mrdoob.com/lab/javascript/webgl/clouds" target="_blank">cloud scene by mrdoob.</a></p>

                 took awhile, and written in the fragment shader. The pulsing, on the other hand, was
                written in javascript to manipulate the uniforms. I thought this was a good lesson in

          <h1 class="size-50">Known "Bugs", Future Iterations, and Takeaways</h1>
          <div class="col-md-12">
              <p>I feel ambiguous about whether the word "bugs" should be applied to the following, as the program works currently works as intended
                but definitely could be improved on the functionality side in future iterations. Therefore, this is a list of "bugs"/future things to implement.
              <ul>
                <li>The background texture eventually blends into a seamless purple if left open for too long; the fragment shader code could be improved
                to loop or replace the texture when that happens</li>
                <li>When the clouds/ball/etc. migrate off the screen, I could perhaps write something to automatically place them back at their initial
                positions. Or, I could make infinite clouds appear afterwards</li>
                <li>Allowing the user to apply different shader materials to the ball itself</li>
                <li>The mouse interaction overlaps with trying to manipulate features on the GUI; I could try to have the event listener ignore any movement
                inside the GUI box</li>
                <li>Controlling cloud speed</li>
                <li>& etc.</li>
              </ul>
              <p> As I worked on this project, it quickly became apparent that there seemed to be an infinite amount of concepts to master
               in order to get a good handle on writing shaders. This meant that even though I spent a very large time trying to learn about shaders
               from the ground up, I'm sure I've only touched the tip of the iceberg. There were dozens that I came across that looked extremely
               promising, but realistic time constraints would bar me from implementing for this iteration.

               <p>  Most notably, in terms of shaders, the next concept I would like to implement is linking the scene lights to the custom shaders
                 (so we could perhaps get a shadow on the clouds from the ball bouncing). Currently, the scene lights are only manipulating the shading
                 on the ball (as it is of a phong material).

               <p> In this iteration, I also only focused on manipulating the fragment shaders; in the future I would like to try manipulating the vertex
                 shaders and creating displacements across the surfaces of the geometries (also perhaps combining it with a fragment shader manipulation
                 to make objects "glow").

               <p>I'd also like to try making use of various shader libraries currently written by members of the three.js community. There are other shader
                 concepts I'd like to try, but this list would never end. Overall however, I've learned an indordinate amount of things through this project.
